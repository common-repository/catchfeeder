= About Catchfeeder =

CatchFeeder is an app that will list products from your store on the www.catch.com.au marketplace. Any sales from Catch will be sent back to your store for fulfilment.

When you install CatchFeeder, it will import products from your store and you can choose which products you want to list on Catch.

Products are kept up to date with automated syncing between WooCommerce, CatchFeeder and Catch.

You can also make changes to your products in CatchFeeder without changing them in your store. This means that you can have a different price or product title on Catch to your store.

Orders from Catch.com.au are sent through to your store for easy fulfilment with your existing processes.

Product and Inventory Syncing - CatchFeeder keeps your products and inventory in sync with automated syncs between WooCommerce, CatchFeeder and Catch.

Prevent Overselling -If you carry shallow stock you can also add a stock buffer.
